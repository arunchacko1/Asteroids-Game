# Asteroids-Game
A simple, classic-style Asteroids video game built using Python and Pygame. Fly your ship through space, avoid asteroids, and shoot them down before they hit you! This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, multi-file Python project structure, and how to use Pygame for real-world game development.
